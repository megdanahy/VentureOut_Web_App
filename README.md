# Venture Out Web Application
### My contribution to a group project to create a functioning, large scale website to simplify tasks at Venture Out, Virginia Tech's on campus outdoor recreation facility.

### In this repo, you'll find two zip files. One houses the screenshots of the working pages for download, and one houses the HTML code themselves.
Please open the HTML folder in VSCode, or another coding platform similar so you can see the actual code and not the HTML pages without proper formatting.

Due to the structure of the project, I am not able to produce the pages properly as we were using a specific Docker terminal in class to make our pages display properly.
